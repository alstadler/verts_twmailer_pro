# 1. Building Application
Make sure you're on a Linux OS
Navigate to directory, use Makefile (make all), start Server on desired port (./twmailer-pro-server 8080) (Server should start listen on the port and create a blacklist.txt on first runtime), run client with server IP and port (./twmailer-client 127.0.0.1 8080) 
Once connected, client can send commands to server

# 2. Command Syntax

DEL

# 3. Client-Server Architecture
The server listens on a specified port for client connections. Every connection is handled on a seperate thread to ensure concurrent handling of mutltiple clients.
The client connects to the server and sends commands (LOGIN, SEND, LIST, READ, DEL, QUIT) to interact with the server.
The server processes these commands and reacts with appropriate methods.

# 4. Authentication
The server uses an LDAP server for authentication (ldap.technikum-wien.at). The server binds to the LDAP server using username and password provided by user. On successfull authentification, a session is established for user.

# 5. IP-Blacklisting
After 3 failed login attempts from an IP, the IP will be blacklisted for 1 minute to prevent brute-forcing. It is stored persistently and reloaded on server startup.

# 6. Message Handling
Users can send messages to another. These are stored in an inbox file associated with the user. 

# 7. Synchronization
The server is multi-threaded and uses mutexes and lock guards for shared resources.
Protected sections by mutexes include session management, mail spool and IP blacklisting.
